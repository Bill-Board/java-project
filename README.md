# Hotel Management System Using Java and DBMS 

**Project Title:** Hotel Management System Using Java and DBMS .

**Overview:** The Room Booking System with Admin Panel is a Java-based web application that facilitates efficient room management and booking services. The project aims to provide a user-friendly platform for customers to reserve rooms while offering administrators robust control over room availability and customer data.

  **Key Objectives:**
  Customer Convenience: The project's primary goal is to create a seamless experience for customers who want to book rooms for various      purposes, such as conferences, events, or accommodations.

  **Efficient Room Management:** The application seeks to optimize the way rooms are managed and booked, minimizing conflicts and       
  maximizing room utilization.

  **Authentication and Authorization:** The system ensures secure access to the admin panel through authentication and implements role-  
  based authorization to control user privileges.

  **Customer Records:** All customer information, including personal details and booking history, is securely stored in a database, 
  allowing easy retrieval and management.

  **Functionalities:**

  **Customer Registration and Authentication:**

  Customers can sign up and create accounts using unique credentials.
  Secure authentication mechanisms are employed to verify user identities during the sign-in process.
  **Admin Panel:**

  Administrators have exclusive access to the admin panel with elevated privileges.
  The admin panel allows administrators to manage rooms, view bookings, and update room availability.
  **Room Booking:**

  Customers can browse available rooms, view their specifications, and check their availability on desired dates.
  The system allows customers to make room reservations based on availability.
  
  **Data Security:**

  The project incorporates various security measures, such as hashing and salting passwords, to protect sensitive customer data.
  SQL injection and input validation techniques are employed to prevent potential vulnerabilities.


**Technologies Used:** List the technologies and tools you utilized in the project, such as:

- Java (programming language)
- DBMS (Database Management System)
- Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

**Authentication:**
Describe the authentication system you implemented for the project. Explain how users are required to sign in securely to access the admin panel and other functionalities. Highlight the methods you used to ensure user credentials are protected, such as hashing passwords, salting, or other security measures.

**Authorization:**
Detail the authorization mechanisms you put in place. Explain how different user roles were defined (e.g., admin, customer) and how you controlled access to specific features based on these roles. Mention any role-based access control (RBAC) or other authorization techniques you employed.

**Customer Records:**
Explain how customer data is managed and stored on the server. Highlight any privacy or data protection measures you implemented to safeguard sensitive customer information.

**Room Booking System:**
Provide an overview of the room booking system, including how customers can check room availability and make bookings. Mention any restrictions or special rules in the booking process, if applicable.

**Security:**
Emphasize any additional security features you incorporated, such as preventing SQL injection, input validation, and other measures to protect the system from vulnerabilities.

The Room Booking System with Admin Panel demonstrates the successful implementation of authentication, authorization, and efficient       room management. Through its intuitive interface, customers can easily make reservations, while administrators have powerful tools to     oversee and control the system. The project showcases strong Java programming skills and a solid understanding of database management     systems to create a robust and secure application.
